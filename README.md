# Symphony Extensions Network

##### The central place to discuss, organize and optimize the Symphony CMS extensions ecosystem.

**Note:** _Besides serving as an issue tracker for symphonyextensions.com and all things related to the extensions ecosystem this repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of best practices, guidelines and resources regarding extension development and maintenance. We encourage every extension developer to not only keep an eye on this repository (watch/star), but to join the discussion and help us build a platform that in the long run finally might define who, what and wherefore the "symphonists" are :)_

## Scope & Focus

- [x] **Extension Adoption**
- [ ] Extension Consolidation

## Extension Adoption

If you own extensions that you no longer want to support, update or care about we'd encourage you to take the following steps to help us find a new home for them:

1. Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/symphonists/symphony-extensions-network/issues/new) (one per extension).
2. Give it a descriptive title: _"Extension Adoption: Extension Name"_.
3. Add a link to the extension repository.
4. Optionally add a short statement about the current state of the extension.
5. If possible give [Nicolas](https://github.com/nitriques) admin access to the repo so he can manage the transfer for you. <sup><a href="#extension-adoption-f1">1</a></sup>

Depending on the state, popularity and usefulness of the extension we will then either …

- … try to find a developer who is willing to take over ownership and further maintenance/development.
- … transfer the repo to the symphonists organization and provide best possible support there.
- … mark the extension as deprecated and transfer it to the "symphonists archives".

If you don't give Nicolas admin access to the repo we'll need you to take action after a solution is agreed upon. Thus it would be great if you could keep an eye on the discussion and be available to manage the [repo transfer](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/) yourself.
